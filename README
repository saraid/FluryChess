Just writing a vaguely extensible implementation of basic chess because I feel way out of practice in Ruby.

FluryChess is something I first wrote in Java when I still liked that language. I still have an old copy of my implementation ...somwehere... but it's not worth copying and Ruby is just That Much Cooler anyways.
